1
00:00:03,580  --> 00:00:05,650
Another summer day

2
00:00:05,650  --> 00:00:08,160
Has come and gone away

3
00:00:08,160  --> 00:00:10,190
In Paris and Rome

4
00:00:10,190  --> 00:00:14,800
I want to go home

5
00:00:14,800  --> 00:00:19,310
Mmmmmm

6
00:00:19,310  --> 00:00:21,490
Maybe surrounded by

7
00:00:21,490  --> 00:00:23,810
A million people I

8
00:00:23,810  --> 00:00:25,790
Still feel all alone

9
00:00:25,790  --> 00:00:29,750
I just want to go home

10
00:00:29,750  --> 00:00:34,190
Oh I miss you, you know

11
00:00:34,190  --> 00:00:38,110
And I've been keeping all the letters

12
00:00:38,110  --> 00:00:41,720
That I wrote to you

13
00:00:41,720  --> 00:00:45,510
Each one a line or two

14
00:00:45,510  --> 00:00:50,020
I'm fine, baby, how are you

15
00:00:50,020  --> 00:00:51,860
Well I would send them but

16
00:00:51,860  --> 00:00:57,290
I know it's that it's just not enough

17
00:00:57,290  --> 00:01:01,270
The words were cold and flat

18
00:01:01,270  --> 00:01:08,580
And you deserve more, than that

19
00:01:08,580  --> 00:01:10,610
Another aeroplane

20
00:01:10,610  --> 00:01:12,540
Another sunny place

21
00:01:12,540  --> 00:01:15,010
I'm lucky, I know

22
00:01:15,010  --> 00:01:18,950
But I want to go home

23
00:01:18,950  --> 00:01:22,940
I've got to go home

24
00:01:22,940  --> 00:01:30,740
Let me go home

25
00:01:30,740  --> 00:01:32,900
I'm just to far

26
00:01:32,900  --> 00:01:34,620
From where you are

27
00:01:34,620  --> 00:01:38,710
I've got to come home

28
00:01:38,710  --> 00:01:46,460
Let me come home

29
00:01:46,460  --> 00:01:48,670
I've had my run

30
00:01:48,670  --> 00:01:50,400
Baby I'm done

31
00:01:50,400  --> 00:01:55,070
I want to come home

32
00:01:55,070  --> 00:01:56,900
And I feel just like

33
00:01:56,900  --> 00:02:02,200
I'm living someone else's life

34
00:02:02,200  --> 00:02:06,230
It's like I just stepped outside

35
00:02:06,230  --> 00:02:10,570
When everything was going right

36
00:02:10,570  --> 00:02:18,010
And I know just why you could not come along with me

37
00:02:18,010  --> 00:02:21,770
'Cause this was not your dream

38
00:02:21,770  --> 00:02:29,160
But you always believed in me

39
00:02:29,160  --> 00:02:30,870
Another winter day

40
00:02:30,870  --> 00:02:33,160
Has come and gone away

41
00:02:33,160  --> 00:02:35,560
In either Paris and Rome

42
00:02:35,560  --> 00:02:39,620
And I want to go home

43
00:02:39,620  --> 00:02:43,730
I miss you, you know

44
00:02:43,730  --> 00:02:51,360
Let me go home

45
00:02:51,360  --> 00:02:53,600
I've had my run

46
00:02:53,600  --> 00:02:55,500
Baby I'm done

47
00:02:55,500  --> 00:02:59,440
I want to go home

48
00:02:59,440  --> 00:03:07,170
Let me go home

49
00:03:07,170  --> 00:03:10,390
It'll all be alright

50
00:03:10,390  --> 00:03:14,480
I'll be home tonight

51
00:03:14,480  --> 00:03:30,000
I'm coming back home
